        <p> Hello, a little about myself and my <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/games/warhammer/"> hobby. </a> Not until recently, or better to say, I was 
        not into <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-us/"> Warhammer modeling </a> until after getting married. After getting married, my husband, 
        an avid fan, showed me how to build and paint models. I haven't yet gotten to the stage of playing the game yet, but soon.  I enjoy being able to spend 
        time with my husband, and it also helps me calm after a long workday or week. </p>

        <p> Once you pick the model you like to build, which comes in a box with many small pieces to assemble, on the plus side, they have 
        instructions on how to put the model together. After that is completed, you will need to pick the color scheme; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzjJqNV4Ei0">I find a video tutorial on painting that exact model </a> because I'm not very good at painting yet. After the painting is completed, 
        you can find a local store or a group of friends that enjoy playing the game and set-up a match to play. </p>
